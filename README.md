## üß† Overview
Accurate segmentation of the left ventricle (LV) in echocardiograms is crucial for cardiac diagnostics but is challenging due to inherent noise, low contrast, and ambiguous boundaries in ultrasound images. This repository accompanies our paper introducing **Echo-DND**, a novel diffusion probabilistic model (DPM) specifically designed to address these challenges.

Echo-DND introduces several key innovations:
*   A **Synergistic Dual-Noise Strategy:** Uniquely combines Gaussian and Bernoulli noises within the diffusion framework, effectively modeling both continuous sensor-like variations and the discrete binary nature of segmentation masks.
*   A **Multi-scale Fusion Conditioning Module (MFCM):** Employs multi-resolution feature extraction and cross-resolution fusion to preserve high-resolution spatial details, crucial for precise boundary delineation.
*   **Spatial Coherence Calibration (SCC):** Incorporates a pixel-wise calibration technique that complements the diffusion process to maintain spatial integrity and consistency in the output segmentation masks.

Our model was rigorously validated on the public CAMUS and EchoNet-Dynamic datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance and establishing a new benchmark in echocardiogram LV segmentation. Echo-DND's architecture holds promise for broader applicability in other medical imaging tasks.
